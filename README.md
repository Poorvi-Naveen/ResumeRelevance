An **AI-powered recruitment co-pilot** designed to automate, analyze, and enrich the resume evaluation process.

---

## The Problem
At organizations like **Innomatics Research Labs**, the manual process of sifting through thousands of resumes for a handful of job openings is a major bottleneck. Recruiters spend countless hours matching resumes to job descriptions (JDs), leading to:

- **Slow Turnaround**: Delays in shortlisting candidates for hiring companies.  
- **Inconsistency**: Subjective judgments from different evaluators.  
- **High Workload**: Placement staff are buried in administrative tasks instead of focusing on high-value activities like student mentorship and interview preparation.  

---

## Our Solution: Automated Resume Relevance Checker
**Automated Resume Relevance Checker** is a web-based platform that transforms resume evaluation from a manual chore into an intelligent, automated workflow.  

It serves as an **AI Co-pilot** for placement teams, providing not just scores, but **actionable, generative insights** to streamline the entire hiring pipeline.

Our system leverages a **hybrid AI approach**, combining traditional keyword and semantic matching with the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to provide a holistic analysis of each candidate.

## Key Features

### Automated Hybrid Scoring
Calculates a precise **Relevance Score (0â€“100)** by combining:
- **Keyword Matching**: Identifies essential skills, tools, and qualifications.  
- **Semantic Matching**: Understands the contextual relevance of a candidate's experience and projects.  

### GenAI Candidate Co-pilot *(USP)*
Goes beyond scoring to provide **generative insights**:
- **Personalized Feedback**: Custom, encouraging feedback for each student, highlighting strengths and offering suggestions for resume improvement.  
- **Targeted Interview Questions**: Generates technical and behavioral questions based on the intersection of the resume and JD, saving recruiters valuable preparation time.  

### Interactive Dashboard
A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** that allows recruiters to:
- Upload a JD and hundreds of resumes in a single batch.  
- Filter and sort candidates by score, verdict, and name.  
- Visualize candidate comparisons with interactive charts.  

### Persistent Storage & File Access
- Results stored in a cloud **PostgreSQL database**.  
- Uploaded resumes and JDs saved for direct access and review.
